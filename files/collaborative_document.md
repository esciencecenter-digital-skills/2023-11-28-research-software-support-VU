## 🔧 Exercises

### FAIR Software
#### Exercise: FAIR in practice
Role playing exercise: One person presents the software, the other person gives feedback.

Tasks for presenter:

- What is the software about?
- Who will use it?
- What is the expected lifecycle of the software?
- What potential users or applications are untapped?

Tasks for reviewer:

- Which FAIR principles are addressed?
- How can the software be made more FAIR?
- What would be the next step (low-hanging fruit)?

Together:

- Define the next steps for the software

Goals:

- Frame an assessment positively: always start with assessing the things that have been done that contribute to good management and FAIR software. This is crucial, as well as motivating.


Choose a software project for this exercise, preferably one you are familiar with.

If you don't have a project in mind, you can use one of the following:
- [Xenon](https://research-software-directory.org/software/xenon)
- [ESMValTool](https://research-software-directory.org/software/esmvaltool)
- [RS-DAT](https://research-software-directory.org/projects/rs-dat)
- [Haddock](https://research-software-directory.org/software/haddock3)
- [worcs](https://cjvanlissa.github.io/worcs/index.html)

### Software Management Plans
#### Exercise: 

*In a live setting, this exercise is done in groups.
Each group will be assigned a software project.
The group will then create an SMP for this project.*

##### Step 1: Choose a software project

With your group, choose a software project for this exercise, preferably one you are familiar with.

If you don't have a project in mind, you can use one of the following:
- A python analysis script, specific to a single research project
- Digital Stethoscope software 
- [Xenon](https://research-software-directory.org/software/xenon)
- [ESMValTool](https://research-software-directory.org/software/esmvaltool)
- [worcs](https://cjvanlissa.github.io/worcs/index.html)
- The software that manages the [observations on the Extremele Large Telescope](https://elt.eso.org/telescope/controls/#telescope-controls-layers)

Find the Practical Guide at [tinyurl.com/SMP-guide](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7589725).

##### Step 2: Assess the management level needed

- Look at the software repository or page in the Research Software Directory
- Assess which core requirements should apply to this piece of software.
- Cut the hexagons out of your diagram and paste them in a, to you logical structure on a fresh sheet. 

For this, use the following considerations (section 5 in [the guide](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7589725)):

1. **Purpose**. What is the current reason or expected end-use for developing the software?
2. **Reliability**. The effect of software failure and/or non-maintenance on:
    - Risk of harm to self or others. This includes injury, privacy violation, bias, and inappropriate content.
    - Reputation. For example to self, institution or other.
    - Research, either your own or of others. This effect could be due to an obvious software failure ("crash") or a hidden one, for example, returning inconsistent numerical results on different operating systems.
3. **Maintenance**. The long-term effort needed to maintain the software as long as it might be used as a standalone tool or dependency. This includes maintenance functions that can extend beyond the lifespan of the original development project and includes fixing bugs, dependency management, operating system compatibility, and security issues.

This may not be a clear-cut decision, but that is fine.
The goal is to get a sense of the level of management needed.
Discuss with your group and come to a consensus.


##### Step 3: Fill in the SMP template (!Bonus!)

Write down some notes on how you plan to implement these core requirements next to each hexagon.

### Software licensing
 
#### Exercise 1: Choose a license for or using your policy (10 minutes)

One of the concerns typically addressed in a software policy is licensing of software developed at the institution. Policies can choose a single license, or offer a range of options.

Try to find out whether your university has a license policy. What does it say about which license(s) to use? If you don't have a policy yet, which license(s) would you choose for your policy? Why?

Go to [Choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com) and play around with the options to help you choose.

Narmin: Apache License 2.0 - because it provides the possibility to give credits to owner/creator
irene: i would go for https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/

[This appendix](https://choosealicense.com/appendix/) is very useful :+1: 

## Feedback (morning)

### Tip
- Participants need better preparation for the exercises (what kind of software?)
- More context because of lack of experience with research software
- More time on software management plans
- Icebreaker could use an introduction of names within the group
- Target audience works mainly with smaller scripts
- Would like more practical examples vs principles and guidelines
- More time for discussion and questions
- Don't skip the SMP slide that puts everything together!
- More time for the SMP part and translation to practical examples

### Top
- Good pace
- Space for questions
- Time management was really good
- Icebreaker was really nice
- Interactive exercises in between are nice, to apply what has been explained
- Like the agenda and diverse small group
- Several levels of software management plans are nice
- The collaborative document is awesome
- Interactive session is nice, more of that would be nice


## Feedback (afternoon)

### Top
- Like the engagement and questions
- I learned new things
- Licensing is one of the most common questions
- Expert on licenses was great
- Liked all the content
- We should all meet each other more often
- Liked that you were with four people to have a change of energy/storytelling now and then
- Liked that everything is available on the platform
- Liked the amount of time spent on each topic, pace was good
- Learned a lot, lot of information, good combination and teamwork

### Tip
- Too much choice, and more of a middle ground, more actionable
- More exercises, we have seen an overview, but more examples would be good
- Divide into [what is the minimum, what is next nice step, what is the ultimate goal]
- Confused about registry vs repository vs archive vs other things
- Licenses in the morning, start at reuse and end at SMP's
- Morning heavy stuff, afternoon application, summary exercise
- Space it a bit, more time per topic
- The discussions were great
- More categorization like in the licensing, more tables and diagrams
- Would be nice to have more examples, video, block of text, real world examples
